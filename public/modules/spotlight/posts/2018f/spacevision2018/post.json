            "As a new chapter of the Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS), STAR members were able to attend the 2018 SpaceVision Conference hosted in San Diego. The conference was three days long and hosted by Lockheed Martin. They held activities for students such as a trivia night and a banquet at the end of the conference. There was also a question box, where students could solve engineering problems with the opportunity to enter the box (which had screens congratulating the student and showing them flying through space) and win a copy of the Voyager Golden Record. Students also had the chance to network throughout the conference, as well as attend the career fair and talk to representatives from Boeing, NASA, Lockheed, Virgin Orbit, and other companies. During the day there were many speakers and panelists discussing their roles in the space world, as well as workshops that students could attend. This was a fantastic opportunity for STAR, and weâ€™re looking forward to the 2019 conference!"
