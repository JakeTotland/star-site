            "The Aerospike team, led by Vivek Vidyarthi, has been busy this semester beginning their project from the ground up. For some background, Aerospike nozzles are potential replacements to conventional bell-shaped nozzle and allow for Single Stage to Orbit (SSTO) vehicles. They have currently created a script which produces an optimized contour design for the aerospike using the output characteristic of a motor along with a corresponding pressure distribution. Additionally, they are in the preliminary stages of putting together parameters for the motor test stand.",

            "The end goal of this project is to design both the aerospike and a static test bench with a functioning liquid motor that will be available to STAR members. We look forward to seeing this new project progress in the spring semester."
