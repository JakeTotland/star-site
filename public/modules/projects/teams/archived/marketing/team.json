We keep the social media pages updated, letting everyone know of our events, as well as covering the notable accomplishments of Star's project teams through Star Spotlight. We are also currently working sharing the funding campaign for CubeSat, as well as a podcast hosted by the startup Shuttle. We hope to be able to promote Star and its achievements to the rest of Rutgers and beyond."
