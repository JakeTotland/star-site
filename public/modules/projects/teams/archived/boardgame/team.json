            "In the modern world, team-building experiences are vital to future success. It is difficult for individuals to single-handedly accomplish monumental tasks without help from a team. Knowing this, Star is producing a space-themed board game that teaches players the necessity of working as a team to foster success. Within our concepts are realistic elements of space exploration, including restrictions on viable space-faring destinations based on ship and cargo specs. We are currently in the Alpha stage of development and intend to begin production within a year."
