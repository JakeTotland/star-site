            "The School Outreach team is focused on bringing space-related STEM outreach programs to elementary, middle and high schools in New Jersey. Our intent is to demonstrate to students how the science that they learn can be applied to exploring and studying our universe, and to inspire them to be scientists and ask questions about the things they see. The Outreach team has already run a successful program at Roosevelt Elementary School in New Brunswick on the wonders and uses of light in studying and understanding space. We hope to continue to conduct fun and impactful programs with more schools in the future.",

            "Our programs can be tailored to a particular classroomâ€™s needs and interests, as many of the topics that are covered can also be applied in space, whether it be the weather or geology on other planets, how we use mechanics to understand orbits, or how we use our understanding of gravity to escape the Earth, or to set our GPS. Additionally, we hope to use our resources to provide additional space-related science resources to local schools to continue to inspire students to be excited about space and all that we have yet to learn."
