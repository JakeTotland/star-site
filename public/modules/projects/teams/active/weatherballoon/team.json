            "The STAR Weather Balloon team aims to provide members experience with developing hardware and software capable of autonomously performing science and collecting data. Our first projects will focus on using the weather balloon as a testing platform for radio communication systems in conjunction with our Antenna team. In the future, we hope to test our CubeSat radio and communication systems, utilizing weather balloons as a prototyping and testing platform. With everything remote, we hope to continue building at home and learning about the systems!"
