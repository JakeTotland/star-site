                Welcome to the Space Technology Association of Rutgers! Slack is the group messaging service preferred by <span class="upper">Star</span> members and project teams. It may seem daunting, but Slack is simple and accessible, with a focus on productivity. If you're unfamiliar with Slack, please skim through this guide to get acquainted. The <b>bolded</b> text is meant to catch your eye as you read, if you're getting set up for the first time. While reading this guide, as with all other pages on this site, you may click the circular <span class="upper">Star</span> logo in the top-left corner of the screen to jump back to the top of the page.

                Slack is designed for ease of use on mobile devices (and is available on both the App Store and Google Play Store), but it also has a great desktop application. Slack works well in your browser too, but for convenience you will at least want the app. <b>Clicking the above link, no matter your device, should take you to a place where you can easily download Slack.</b>

                The first URL above ("Invite Link") is the invite link to the <span class="upper">Star</span> slack. Share it to other members who do not yet have access to our Slack. After downloading Slack, clicking this link will send you to a signup page where you can register for <span class="upper">Star</span>’s Slack for the first time and join <span class="upper">Star</span>’s workspace. Do not enter Slack from this link unless you are creating an account for use with <span class="upper">Star</span> for the first time! Notice that other Slack accounts you may have are not linked to <span class="upper">Star</span> by default, and that you can use a different email for each workspace you join if you so choose. I.e., <b>if you have never used Slack specifically for <span class="upper">Star</span> before, click the first link above ("Invite Link"). If you have already set up your account, sign in with the second link above ("Workspace URL")</b>.
                <br><br>
                When first signing up, you will be prompted for your name and some information to create your account with. You are also encouraged to include a profile to be displayed to everyone in the group. In the <span class="upper">Star</span> workspace, there is no restriction on which email you must register with, although some other organizations using Slack may demand you register to their workspace with an email that they gave you.
                <br><br>
                On your browser and some devices, <b>signing into the app may prompt you for <span class="upper">Star</span>’s workspace URL</b>. This is the other link above ("Workspace URL"). You can also use this link to access the <span class="upper">Star</span> workspace on your browser if you already have an account linked to <span class="upper">Star</span>’s slack.
                <br><br>
                <b>In case you are unable to click second the link above, this is <span class="upper">Star</span>’s workspace URL: https://ruspacetech.slack.com</b>

                It is often useful to “like” a post or easily share your opinion in a quantifiable way without spamming the chat. To this end, Slack uses “reactions” (e.g. “thumbs up emoji”). To add a reaction to someone’s message, tap their message (on mobile) or scroll over it (on desktop) and tap/click the icon that looks like a smiling emoji with a plus sign on it. This will bring you to a menu on which you can select from hundreds of emoji and react to the message with whichever one you choose.
                <br><br>
                Slack keeps track of and displays the reactions to a message next to the message itself, in the channel. If you notice that a certain message has been reacted-to, you can check which users have reacted with each emoji by tapping and holding (on mobile) or hovering your mouse over (on desktop) the reaction emoji in question.

                When typing a message, typing @ and a username will directly notify the user you name. You can do this anywhere within your message.
                e.g. @timothy
                <br><br>
                Typing <b>#</b> and the name of a channel will create a link to the channel you call. You can do this anywhere within your message.
                e.g. <b>#general</b>

                Giphy is an interaction we added for fun. Sending <em>/giphy [subject]</em> (substituting <em>[subject]</em> with something else) into any channel will generate a preview of a random gif from the giphy database that has been tagged with whatever your subject is. You can then either ask for a different gif or send that one.
                <br><br>
                Your gif will not actually be sent unless you first call giphy and then specifically choose to send the gif, after it shows you the preview.
                e.g. /giphy elonmusk

                Threads are like sub-chats for side conversations. You can use them to talk to one or more people within a channel without constantly notifying (spamming) the entire channel, while still giving the entire channel access to view/participate in the thread if they choose to.
                <br><br>
                You can start a thread within a channel as a response to your own initial message or someone else’s. On mobile, tap on the message you want to start a thread under then select Start a thread; on Desktop, hover over the message with your mouse and click the icon (looks like a message blurb) for starting a thread. When starting or replying to a thread, if you check the box <em>Also send to <b>#channel</b></em>, the channel’s members will be notified of your message. If you don’t check this box, the channel can still see and participate in the thread. The only change that occurs when this box is left unchecked is that the rest of the channel will not receive a notification in the channel. The one exception to this rule is if a user has been called with @user, in which case they will be notified that you mentioned them in a thread. <b>It is usually best practice in a thread to leave the <em>Also send to #channel</em> box unchecked but to @user the people who need to see the message</b> so you do not spam the channel, but the necessary parties still get notified.
                <br><br>
                For ease of access, you can see all the threads you are involved in under the Threads section in the navigation sidebar.

                This is intuitive, but on the navigation sidebar there is also a section for direct messages. Tapping/clicking the words Direct Messages will open a menu of all members of the workspace you can message directly. Only those you select will be able to see the messages you send in this way.
                <br><br>
                You can use the direct message interface with your own account as a space for notes and testing the features of Slack.

                Slack supports file sharing. Simply tap or click the plus button (on Desktop) or the file-and-paperclip button (on Mobile) next to the text input box for messages and choose the file from your system or Google Drive that you would like to upload to the channel.

                Slack has interfaces for many other applications (e.g. giphy). If a project team or channel needs access to the features of a certain app through Slack (e.g. Google Docs or Asana for productivity), contact the webmaster to discuss implementation. If the service is not intuitive, a note will be made on how to use it in this document.
